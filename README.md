Students should use this [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) for self-checking their submission.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


To play, open index.html in a browser.
Use the "up," "down," "left," and "right" arrow keys on your keyboard to reach the water without colliding with any bugs. If you hit a bug, you will return to the grass, where you started. When you reach the water, you will also go back to your starting point so you can keep playing. Have fun!
